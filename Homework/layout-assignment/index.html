      <h1>What is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies are a new trend taking over the news by storm, and a lot of people don't really know what they are. Cryptocurrencies are a form of currency just like the US Dollar, however it is not backed by the US Treasury and Trust. Cryptocurrencies
        are based off Distrubted Public Ledger, and use the power of algorithms to secure the transactions. It incentives bookkeepers to maintain the ledger by offering rewards and other incentives. All these methods come together in what they call, The
        Blockchain. </p>
